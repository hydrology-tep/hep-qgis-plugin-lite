   <H1>Generate Model Description and climate files</H1>
   This module writes the model description file and empty SWAT climate files for the model. You need to specify the model subcatchment shapefile in lat-long and indicate which column of its attribute table holds the subcatchment IDs. You also need to specify the centroid shapefile and indicate columns for latitude, longitude and elevation.
   <H3>Storage location for model description file</H3>
   <H3>Name of the model description file</H3>
   <H3>Name of the model</H3>
   <H3>Type of model</H3>
   You need to indicate whether the model should run in real time (RT) or over a historical simulation period (Hist).
   <H3>Starting date of the model YYYYMMDD</H3>
   <H3>Model sub-basin shapefile (in lat-lon)</H3>
   <H3>Name of shapefile column holding sub IDs</H3>
   <H3>Storage location for model climate station file</H3>
   <H3>Name of forecast dates file</H3>
   <H3>Precipitation scaling factor</H3>
   <H3>Model sub-basin centroid shapefile (in lat-lon)</H3>
   <H3>Name of centroid file column holding Latitude</H3>
   <H3>Name of centroid file column holding Longitude</H3>
   <H3>Name of centroid file column holding Elevation</H3>
